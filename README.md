# Zef-Series
C64 Programming Tutorial Series

This is where I will be saving my source code for this tutorial series.  

Right now the source code consists of one basic program "zef.bas" and a few assembly language programs.

The first one "zef1.asm" was my first cut at converting the basic program into assembler.  The second one, "zef2.asm" is my optimized version.
